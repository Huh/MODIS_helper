# MODIS helper

_This code doesn't function last time I checked due to changes in MODISTools and rts.  Newer packages, webservices and the evolution of my interaction with MODIS products has prompted me to abandon this code in favor of newer approaches that I will share as a package as soon as possible._

A simple application to find MODIS tiles and summary information about MODIS products available through the MODIS API and the MODISTools package.

The purpose of this application is to make it easy to identify the MODIS tiles needed by pointing and clicking on a map.  The code for the shiny application is also included and highlights the use of leaflet and the DT packages in R.

This is a quick and dirty application that gets the job done.
